note: 
Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. 
If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

# download a backup zip first !!!!
# ensure a totally fresh copy
rm -f -R -v VRDTVSP
git clone hhttps://github.com/hydra3333/VRDTVSP.git
cd VRDTVSP
git config --global user.name "hydra3333"
git config --global user.email "hydra3333@gmail.com"
git config --global credential.helper store
# Checkout to a branch named latest_branch which has no history
git checkout --orphan latest_branch
# Add all the files
git add -A
# Commit the changes
git commit -am "committing an orphan branch"
# Delete the master branch
git branch -D main
# Rename the branch latest_branch to master
git branch -m main
# Finally, force update your repository
git push -f origin main  # Force push main branch to github
# remove the old files (loose objects)
git gc --aggressive --prune=all
